# Image compression using Principal-Component-Analysis on Olivetti face dataset         JULY'2020
• Implemented the linear dimensionality reduction technique PCA on Olivetti face dataset\
• Constructed a small set of basis images (Eigenimages) by finding the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the image dataset\
• Reduced dimensionality by projecting images onto a lower dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenimages\
• Analyzed the reconstruction loss, measured as a function of the number of principal components.
