• Implemented the linear dimensionality reduction technique PCA on Olivetti face dataset.
• Constructed a small set of basis images (Eigenimages) by finding the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the image dataset
• Reduced dimensionality by projecting images onto a lower dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenimages
• Analyzed the reconstruction loss, measured as a function of the number of principal components.
